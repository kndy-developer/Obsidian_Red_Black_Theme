# Obsidian_Red_Black_Theme
 A Red and Black Dark Theme for Obsidian.
 All you need to is Download the CSS file (theme.css), go to Settings --> Appearance --> click the Folder Icon in the Themes section and drag or copy the CSS file into the themes folder.
 Then quit out of the Obsidian application, and then relaunch it.  It will show as "theme.css" in the Theme Selection Bar in Settings.
 When applying this theme, make sure to change your "Accent Color" to HEX "#A00000" - this is located in the Settings --> Appearance.
